## Installation

Run bootup.py if you are using this for the first time or in a fresh OS!

#Manually install requirements if needed:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Startup
Make sure you run bootup.py once before starting using the script for the first time!
This is to ensure the time is tracked and it starts recording after reboot or in case the system's date is outdated.

Simply run audiorecording.py to use it after or audiorecording.py run to start recording straight away.
